# Atomic Design Structure

This folder follows the Atomic Design methodology. Components are organized into the following categories:

1. **Atoms**: Small, reusable components like buttons, inputs, and icons.
2. **Molecules**: Groups of atoms working together, such as a search bar.
3. **Organisms**: Complex components composed of molecules and/or atoms, such as a navigation bar.
4. **Templates**: Page layouts combining organisms and molecules.
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates with real content.

### Folder Structure
